Have you ever seen an aerial continuum manipulator that can perform various challenging tasks?
We introduce Aerial Elephant Trunk (AET), which can perform dexterous manipulation tasks in complex environments that are filled with obstacles.
The paper has been accepted by [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/ncomms/).
More details will follow:

Navigating in a highly dynamic and cluttered environment is a very complex task for UAVs. We propose FAPP, a fast and adaptive perception and planning framework for drones.
Check our latest [IEEE Transactions on Robotics](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8860) paper for more details:

Paper: FAPP: Fast and Adaptive Perception and Planning for UAVs in Dynamic Cluttered Environments.
