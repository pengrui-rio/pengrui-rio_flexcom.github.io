## PhD/Postdoc Positions:
We are always looking for highly self-motivated candidates who are interested in developing intelligent vision and control techniques to enhance the intelligence and autonomy of robots including UAVs. We are interested in topics that are essential to enhancing the intelligence of robots, which include but are not limited to:

#### Deep Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Navigation for robots and UAVs
- Deep learning-based scene understanding, object detection and tracking, Large Language Models (LLM)
- Deep reinforcement learning-based control and navigation.

#### Vision-based navigation and control for Robotics
- Vision-based motion planning and obstacle avoidance
- Vision-based object detection and tracking

#### Swarm robotics
- Cooperative SLAM, cooperative control and multi-robot obstacle avoidance for a swarm of robots
- Multi-agent reinforcement learning

#### Visual Odometry and SLAM for robots
- Event-based, vision-based or lidar-based visual odometry
- Event-based, vision-based or lidar-based mapping

#### Soft and continuum robots
- Dynamic control and grasping of soft/continuum arms


# Requirements:

The candidate is strongly expected to have a Master's Degree for applying for a PhD or Doctor's Degree for applying for a postdoc position. He/she should have a relevant research background (Learning, UAV, Manipulation, robotics) and programming skills with C/C++, python and ROS. Experience with drone/robotics development skills such as ROS/Gazebo, OpenCV, and PX4/Issac Gym is a plus. 

# How to apply:

Please email your CV, a PPT file that describes your research experience in detail, and academic transcripts to Dr. Peng Lu (lupeng@hku.hk), quoting [PhD/Postdoc Application]+[your name] in the email subject.
